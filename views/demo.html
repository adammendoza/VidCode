    <h2>You've pulled an effect onto the code editor and magic appeared, congrats!</h2>

    <p>You are now processing your video pixel by pixel to give it that effect.</p>

    <p>Now it's time for you to control that magic.</p>

    <p>You can change the intensity of your effect by replacing the number with a value between 0-20. <strong>Change the number to 20 and see what happens.</strong>

    <p>Javascript has many built in "methods" which, at times, make sense literally.</p>

    <p>Writing the method can be as easy as replacing one word with another.</p>

    <p><strong>So, knowing this is the case, what might you write to pause the video?</strong></p>

    <h2>Awesome!</h2>

    <p> Let's see what's possible in terms of writing code for the "effects" object. </p>

    <p><strong>What happens when you change the name of the effect object?</strong></p>

    <h2>You've learned to write code in all three sections of this code block!  Congrats!</h2>

    <p><strong>Write down a method you would invent to manipulate your video!</strong></p>

    <p>Now we're off to chapter 2 to discover what other video methods are available from the seriously.js library :)</p>
